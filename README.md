# TinyApp project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly)

## Final Products

In this project, I also created a front page for the website that shows all the short URLs that other users have created to the public.

##Screenshots

Note: users can only have access to their own urls
